                    I started with probably one of the most popular coding languages C & C++. I mainly coded
                    mathematical solutions such as the derivative of linear and non-linear functions, or mathematical
                    operators for matrices. But also simple game programs like Hangman were involved..

            Hi, I'm Neslihan. I was born and grew up in Linz, Upper Austria, in 1991. I visited BRG Landwied high school, where
            my only focus was on getting positive grades, except for math. Math was my absolute favorite
            subject, because I enjoyed finding correct solutions to problems. It was like a game to me.
            And like many people are reluctant to lose, I sat on the exercises until I found a solution. The cool
            thing about solutions is, that it does not necessarily be clear. In other words: in most cases, there are
            many solutions. The more challenging the tasks, the more fun the game was.
        </p>
        <p class="myparagraph leftmargin">
            In my family, I was the first person graduating the A-levels and starting to study in university. Of course
            I chose math for my studies. Then at the latest I felt the intensity of the challenge. But I stayed at it
            and financed my studies myself as a part-time job.
        </p>
        <p class="myparagraph leftmargin">
            And that's when I got into coding for the first time. My very first coding languages were C and C++,
            followed by Matlab, Maple and R. When I got into banking, none of the languages were needed. For the
            daily tasks I learned VBA and SQL instead. I must admit, that I am happy for having no more VBA tasks.
            For my next employer, arithmetica, I joined a more complex software project that has been running for over
            10 years.
            Matlab, R and C # were the main languages ​​for the validation software.
        </p>
        <p class="myparagraph leftmargin">
            In 2020, creativity began to become a fulfilling area in my life. I started writing, singing, and dancing
            more than I'd done in my previous years. I got into web design by chance. It was then that the first seeds
            for Fronted were sown. When I started a project in Wordpress I felt like I don't have the freedom to do
            anything for the website, especially when it comes to animations. So I decided to learn HTML and CSS.
            However, I was still not satisfied with the results. When I came to CodeFactory in Vienna, I quickly learned
            JavaScript and TypeScript, because coding was nothing new to me at the time. Then I finally said
            goodbye to the world of banking & insurance, that do look for mathematicians, and took a new direction
            that allows me to be creative and live my simple but very fulfilling life. And when I don't hit the keys, I
            hit the drums.
        </p>
